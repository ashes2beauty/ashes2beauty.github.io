        <title>The magic cleaner</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are all in a constant search to find things to make our lives easier. We often buy things on a whim because it claims to make a specific task easier, just to generally find out that the product does not really live up to our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to save time, effort and money. Does this not also specifically ring true for cleaning? Who wants to scrub a stubborn burnt oven dish endlessly, soak that white sweat-stained shirt five consecutive times, or clean your entire floor with a small toothbrush? I promise you, hardly any one (unless you have some strange type of OCD). We want to have things clean - quickly. Why? Because things tend to get dirty repeatedly, and I’m sure you dont want to struggle repeatedly.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you want to specifically clean things that will not rust. Ceramics, pots, pans, tiled floor, carpets, clothing, upholstery covers (we have white ones!), your bathtub, shower, toilet. Let’s say it is very, very dirty and you are struggling to get it 100% clean. Or you have tried cleaning it before, but there are stubborn stains on your clothing, upholstery covers or carpets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot always use bleach, because it does not always work and it can fade your coloured clothing,. It can also cause stains on the clothes that you are wearing whilst i.e. scrubbing the grout on the floor. I have wasted a good pair of pants because of bleach before. Maybe you want to use something more green than harsh chemicals. Well, I believe the following cleaning potion will assist you with cleaning all above scenarios with success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ingredients aren’t generally expensive or difficult to find. It will not irritate your skin and is safe for the environment. It is safe to use on colour-fast fabrics to remove stains and will generally clean all things that cannot rust. Do not use it on items that can rust, because this mixture is oxidising: it causes metal to rust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will generally need: 
- 1 part 3% Hydrogen Peroxide
- 1 part Washing Soda
- 2 parts Water
- A few drops of Dishwashing liquid
- Scrubby brush&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must not mix and store the ingredients beforehand, because the solution will lose its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The specific amounts will vary with what you are cleaning. For very dirty items you would want to make a paste and scrub with that. If you are soaking a few items overnight, you would want to mix it with a larger amount of water. The temperature of the water will vary with the type of stain in the item. Warm water may set certain stains, and cold water others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t be worried if you do not know what to do where, I am here to help you! Below is a few articles that will give you step by step examples of cleaning with these ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stains (clothing / upholstery/ carpets - article series coming soon!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pots and pans - article coming soon!&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>How to clean your wedding rings</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;../../../../assets/wedding_rings_3.png&quot; width=&quot;490&quot; height=&quot;735&quot; /&gt;
I hardly ever take off my wedding rings. Truth be told, I even do gardening with them.  
The problem is that my rings have all sorts of openings and crevices where little pieces of gunk go live in. I have tried cleaning it with a toothbrush, but it alone cannot remove the gunk out of the small openings.  My rings also tend to get dull due to all sorts of things getting on there- cream, butter, makeup, etc.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one stage my ring broke and I had to take it to the jewelers to get fixed and they also cleaned it. The difference in how my rings looked was amazing to me. It felt like I had a brand new, sparkly friend! But, the problem is that cleaning the jewelry at the jeweler comes at quite a steep (in my humble opinion) cost- especially if you consider how often you would need to take it in for a clean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently found this article at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livingwithlandyn.com/b-l-o-g/2016/4/26/diamond-wash&quot;&gt;Living with Landyn&lt;/a&gt;. There the author of the blog shares a ‘potion’ for cleaning real gold/ diamond/ platinum jewelry. She received this potion from a jeweler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Here are the ingredients:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1/2 cup window cleaner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a few drops teaspoon dish washing detergent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive center-block&quot; src=&quot;../../../../assets/rings2.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The method:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mix the ingredients in a glass, microwaveable container (a container that has a lid).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microwave the ingredients for 1 minute (no lid on, no jewelry inserted)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add jewelry to soak for 5-10 minutes. You can let it soak overnight for a deep clean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gently scrub the jewelry with a soft bristle toothbrush.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rinse jewelry in lukewarm water.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dry with a paper towel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can reuse the solution, hence the lid for the microwaveable container. Whenever you need to clean something, just pop it in the microwave, soak and then store again. Over time the solution will collect more gunk residue. When it gets too much, throw out the solution and mix a new batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are amazing, it does not take much effort and you probably already have all the required ingredients on hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Share below how this worked for you!&lt;/p&gt;
