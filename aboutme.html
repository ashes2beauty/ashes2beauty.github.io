Currently based in Pretoria, South Africa, Ashes 2 Beauty was started by Esteé. I got married about a year ago to a wonderful and loving husband. I soon discovered that I have many skills lacking (especially in the cleaning department); my recipe repertoire is very small and I do not really know how to host guests. Two months after we got married I started my first job. It was very hectic and we basically lived off takeaways and our house was a mess. Working 6 days a week and traveling far left me too tired to cook and clean. I realized the value of quick dinners and speedy cleans.<p>Seven months later I resigned, and without a job, I started staying at home. We are very blessed, but with only one income and expenses to pay, budgeting our monthly expenses became a real priority. As I began researching these various things I started sharing the information with close friends and family. I soon realized that I want to share the information with anyone willing to listen - and I really needed a hobby other than cleaning - I decided to start a blog. I chose the name Ashes 2 Beauty, because I want to show you how to turn things that look like a mess (ashes) to you, into something that makes you happy and rewards you (beauty). Let's be friends, yes?</div></div></div><!--Above the fold non-mobile--><div class="col-sm-3 visible-sm visible-lg visible-md" ><div class="col-sm-12 panel panel-default"><div class="panel-header"><h4 class="text-center">About Me</h4></div><div class="panel-footer"> <img class="img-responsive center-block img-circle" src="../../../../../assets/Estee.jpg" width="200" height="200"><p class="small text-center">Hi there, my name is Esteé.
